## New App Ideas - Evaluate and Categorize

### 1. Gestura
- **Description:**  
  Gestura is an AI-powered mobile app that uses phone camera and may pair with meta glasses to translate American Sign Language (ASL) gestures into text and speech — and vice versa. It enables seamless communication between Deaf and hearing users, while also serving as a learning platform for users to practice and contribute new ASL data to train the model.

- **Category:** Accessibility / Education / AI  

- **Mobile:**  
  Mobile is essential. The app uses the **camera** for gesture capture, the **microphone** for speech input, and **api's** for langaguage translations and avatar generation. Push notifications remind users to practice, contribute training data, or update the mask’s model.

- **Story:**  
  Gestura bridges the gap between spoken and signed communication. Users can hold a phone camera to sign and have their gestures instantly translated into text or speech. Teachers and learners can practice ASL, and researchers can improve dataset quality through community input.

- **Market:**  
  - **Primary:** Deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals, ASL learners, accessibility advocates, educators, and interpreters.  
  - **Secondary:** Schools, hospitals, and government agencies seeking inclusive communication tools.  
  Monetization could include premium AI model training features, partnerships with accessibility institutions, and licensing for organizations.

- **Habit:**  
  Users interact daily — Deaf users rely on it for conversation, learners for practice, and contributors for AI training. Streaks and visual rewards encourage consistent engagement, similar to Duolingo.

- **Scope:**  
  - **V1:** ASL-to-text/speech translation (using trained CNN model).  
  - **V2:** Add text-to-ASL translation with avatar animations.  
  - **V3:** Introduce cloud model updates and community-driven data uploads.  
  - **V4:** Integrate multilingual translation (e.g., Spanish/Japanese to English via ASL).  
  - **V5:** Full LinguaLift smart mask integration for automatic updates and offline use.
