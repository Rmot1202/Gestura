## New App Ideas - Evaluate and Categorize

### 1. Gestura
- **Description:**  
  Gestura is an AI-powered mobile app that uses phone camera and may pair with meta glasses to translate American Sign Language (ASL) gestures into text and speech — and vice versa. It enables seamless communication between Deaf and hearing users, while also serving as a learning platform for users to practice and contribute new ASL data to train the model.

- **Category:** Accessibility / Education / AI  

- **Mobile:**  
  Mobile is essential. The app uses the **camera** for gesture capture, the **microphone** for speech input, and **api's** for langaguage translations and avatar generation. Push notifications remind users to practice, contribute training data, or update the mask’s model.

- **Story:**  
  Gestura bridges the gap between spoken and signed communication. Users can hold a phone camera to sign and have their gestures instantly translated into text or speech. Teachers and learners can practice ASL, and researchers can improve dataset quality through community input.

- **Market:**  
  - **Primary:** Deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals, ASL learners, accessibility advocates, educators, and interpreters.  
  - **Secondary:** Schools, hospitals, and government agencies seeking inclusive communication tools.  
  Monetization could include premium AI model training features, partnerships with accessibility institutions, and licensing for organizations.

- **Habit:**  
  Users interact daily — Deaf users rely on it for conversation, learners for practice, and contributors for AI training. Streaks and visual rewards encourage consistent engagement, similar to Duolingo.

- **Scope:**  
  - **V1:** ASL-to-text/speech translation (using trained CNN model).  
  - **V2:** Add text-to-ASL translation with avatar animations.  
  - **V3:** Introduce cloud model updates and community-driven data uploads.  
  - **V4:** Integrate multilingual translation (e.g., Spanish/Japanese to English via ASL).  
  - **V5:** Full LinguaLift smart mask integration for automatic updates and offline use.

### 2. Gestura Live

* **Description:**
  Gestura Live is a real-time classroom and meeting companion that provides **live captions**, an **ASL avatar side panel**, and **slide synchronization** for lectures, Zoom/Meet calls, and in-person talks. It lets attendees follow along with low-latency captions, see a signing avatar for key content, drop highlights/notes, and export sessions into polished recordings for later study.

* **Category:** Accessibility / Education / AI / Productivity

* **Mobile:**
  Mobile (and web) are essential. The app uses the **microphone** (or system audio) for streaming ASR, optional **camera** for Sign→Text (beta) from Deaf presenters, and **APIs** for text→ASL avatar generation and glossary enforcement. Push notifications alert users when sessions start, slides change, highlights are shared, or exports are ready.

* **Story:**
  Gestura Live levels the playing field in classrooms and meetings. A student joins a session, turns on captions and the ASL avatar panel, and instantly follows complex topics—even in noisy rooms. Instructors get automatic chapters and slide-linked transcripts; accessibility staff gain consistent, reviewable outputs.

* **Market:**

  * **Primary:** Deaf and hard-of-hearing students/professionals, accessibility offices, instructors, note-takers, and meeting organizers.
  * **Secondary:** Universities, K–12 districts, hospitals, enterprises, and government agencies standardizing accessible meetings.
    Monetization may include institutional licenses, per-seat live minutes, premium latency/quality tiers, and compliance add-ons (FERPA/HIPAA options).

* **Habit:**
  Used during every class/meeting. Attendees rely on live captions + avatar; instructors and coordinators use highlights and post-session exports. Streaks for attendance, note-taking badges, and shared class glossaries encourage continued engagement.

* **Scope:**

  * **V1:** Live ASR captions with speaker labels; low-latency text→ASL avatar panel; manual highlights; basic slide markers; export to MP4/HLS with captions.
  * **V2:** Automatic slide-change detection; glossary dictionaries per course; better punctuation/stability controls; one-click LMS publish.
  * **V3:** Sign→Text (beta) input channel for Deaf presenters; collaborative notes; real-time Q&A tied to timestamps.
  * **V4:** Domain presets (STEM/Medical/Legal) with tuned glossaries; multi-language captions; interpreter handoff mode.

### 3. StreamLens

* **Description:**
  StreamLens is a cross-platform companion app that shows **movie and TV metadata** based on the **streaming subscriptions you already have** (e.g., Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video). It doesn’t play content; it aggregates **titles, posters, synopses, cast/crew, genres, runtimes, ratings**, and availability on your services. It tracks what you’ve watched, lets you rate titles, and **recommends** new ones based on your subscriptions and viewing history.

* **Category:** Entertainment / Discovery / Productivity

* **Mobile:**
  Mobile (and web) are essential. The app connects to your providers via secure sign-in, uses **APIs** to pull availability and artwork, and supports **push notifications** for expiring titles, new drops on your services, and watchlist reminders. Optional location/locale helps surface region-correct catalogs.

* **Story:**
  You open StreamLens and see a clean feed of movies you can **actually watch right now** with your subscriptions. One tap shows details (poster, trailer link, cast, critic and user ratings). You mark what you’ve seen, leave a quick rating, and the app refines recommendations that fit **your** services and taste.

* **Market:**

  * **Primary:** Streaming power users, students, families, and film fans juggling multiple subscriptions.
  * **Secondary:** Dorms, hotels, and community centers that want a shared “what to watch” board.
    Monetization could include premium filters (4K/Atmos, director cuts), early-access alerts, affiliate revenue for add-on services, and family plans.

* **Habit:**
  Used a few times per week—before movie nights and during commutes. Streaks for logging, seasonal challenges (e.g., “Spooky October 5”), and shared lists with friends keep engagement high.

* **Scope:**

  * **V1:** Connect subscriptions; browse **only-on-your-services** catalog; title pages (poster, synopsis, cast, runtime, genres); basic **ratings**; **watchlist** and **watched history**; simple recommendations seeded by your ratings + services.
  * **V2:** Smarter recs (collaborative + content-based), **tags** (mood/pace), **expiring soon** and **new this week**; filter by runtime, year, MPAA, language.
  * **V3:** **Social**: shared lists, friend activity (opt-in), group watch picks; **notify when a title moves** to one of your services.
  * **V4:** **Profiles** (household members), multi-criteria “movie night” picker, **calendar view** for releases; offline access to your lists/ratings.
  * **V5:** Cross-device sync (TV companion app), **privacy modes**, advanced analytics (discoverability score, creator stats), and integrations with smart assistants for voice search.
