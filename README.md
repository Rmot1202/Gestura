## Overview

### Description

**Gestura** is an AI-powered mobil app. It translates American Sign Language (ASL) gestures into text and speech — and vice versa — in real time. The app also allows users to learn ASL, contribute gesture data to train models, and stay updated as it with the latest AI model.  
Gestura bridges the communication gap between Deaf and hearing communities through accessibility-focused innovation.

### App Evaluation

- **Category:** Accessibility / Education / AI  
- **Mobile:** Uses the camera for ASL recognition, microphone for voice input, and cloud connectivity for real-time translation and model syncing. Optimized for mobile because gesture tracking, speech input, and AI updates rely on mobile sensors.  
- **Story:** Gestura empowers Deaf and hearing users to communicate seamlessly. It also supports ASL learners and educators through tutorials, practice modules, and a crowd-sourced AI model improvement feature.  
- **Market:** Deaf and hard-of-hearing users, interpreters, students, teachers, and accessibility advocates. Institutions (schools, hospitals, and government offices) can also use it to promote inclusive communication.  
- **Habit:** Users interact daily to translate conversations, practice signing, or contribute gesture samples. Notifications encourage consistent engagement and contribution to improve the AI model.  
- **Scope:**  
  - **V1:** ASL-to-text/speech translation  
  - **V2:** Speech-to-ASL animation (avatar)  
  - **V3:** Cloud-based model updates + gesture data uploads  
  - **V4:** Multilingual translation (e.g., Spanish/Japanese ↔ English via ASL)
